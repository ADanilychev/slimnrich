**Abstract**
What unites more than 50% of the world’s population regardless of nationality, race, or gender?
What leads to physical and psychological discomfort, a wide range of diseases, and a reduced life expectancy?
What can confidently be called the plague of the century, for which there is still no effective treatment? What is something immunity cannot be developed against?
It is a pandemic that has taken over the entire world—one that is actively supported by major corporations, local farmers, and even small retailers.
We are talking about the problem of excess weight.
Our Slim and Rich team makes the weight-loss process as effective as possible.
We help increase motivation and maintain it for as long as necessary to achieve the desired result.
Our solutions can be used both as a supplement to any chosen weight-loss method and as a standalone approach.
We address the core problem of all weight-loss methods: the loss of motivation. We help boost it and keep it at a high level for as long as needed.

**Introduction**
At present, there are several main methods of weight loss and their combinations. Let us briefly review them.
1. Diet
Restriction of food intake. This can take various forms.
The most popular approach is excluding a wide range of foods from the diet, for example those containing carbohydrates and/or fats. This method is quite harmful, as it is difficult to assess the consequences of eliminating certain nutrients from consumption. It is hard to maintain motivation due to psychological and physical limitations. Any trigger can lead to a relapse, and returning to the diet afterward is very difficult.
Reducing overall food volume. This method is more gentle than the previous one. However, any excuse, stressful situation, or event becomes a risk of relapse, as the body finds it difficult to function under conditions of food deficit.
Consumption of specific products. This is similar to excluding certain types of food from the diet, but in an even more extreme form, as deficiencies of various nutrients become more pronounced. It is difficult to maintain motivation due to psychological and physical problems.
2. Physical Activity
Fitness, gym workouts, running.
With a reasonable approach, this is probably the most effective method of weight loss. The drawbacks include an increased risk of injury and, as a result, relapse. When training cannot be continued, weight gain often follows. With excessive intensity—especially at the very beginning—the risk of injury increases many times over. In addition, post-workout soreness is inevitable. Combined with the need to invest sufficient time and certain financial costs, this method requires strong motivation to start. Maintaining motivation is a key challenge for achieving and sustaining weight-loss results.
Group sports
Higher risk of injury. Dependence of interest on results. A gradual decline in interest and motivation over time.
Martial arts / contact sports
Extremely high risk of injury. Strong dependence of interest on personal results. A decline in interest and motivation over time.
Active sports / extreme sports
Extremely high risk of injury. Habituation to adrenaline levels. A decline in interest and motivation over time.
3. Use of special medications, specialized nutrition, etc.
A fairly effective method. It is highly dependent on product quality. With low-quality products, there is a significant risk of developing serious health problems. This approach is also very sensitive to scheduling and dosage. If these are not followed, one may either experience negative consequences or fail to achieve any results at all.
It appears to be the least demanding method in terms of motivation, but once the intake of medications is stopped, the effect disappears immediately, and the person returns to their previous weight.

**Conclusion**
Thus, it can be observed that there is no ideal way to lose weight. The best approaches consist of a harmonious and comfortable combination tailored individually for each person. However, there is one essential element without which it is impossible even to begin the weight-loss process—let alone achieve and maintain lasting results.
That element is motivation. It enables a person to make the difficult decision to start physical activity, change eating habits, and spend money. Motivation is what allows one to continue and achieve meaningful, long-term results. Unfortunately, motivation cannot always be maintained at a sufficient level.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the key factor in successful weight loss, as well as in achieving and maintaining results, is motivation. Supporting it and keeping it at the required level is the primary task during the weight-loss period. Everything else is secondary.

**Solving the Motivation Problem**
The Slim and Rich project was designed specifically to provide sufficient initial motivation and to maintain it at the required level—or even higher—throughout the entire process of comfortable weight loss. Even afterward, we help support motivation to maintain the achieved results at the desired level.
The secret of the app’s high effectiveness lies in the natural sense of excitement and competitiveness inherent in humans. Research has confirmed that with additional financial incentives, people lose 3–4 times more excess weight than those in a control group without rewards (Volpp, K. G., John, L. K., Troxel, A. B., Norton, L., Fassbender, J., & Loewenstein, G., Financial Incentive-Based Approaches for Weight Loss: A Randomized Trial, Journal of the American Medical Association, 300(22), 2631–2637, 2008). Therefore, we chose this method as the core mechanism to boost user enthusiasm and provide effective support throughout the entire weight-loss period initially chosen by the user.
But we did not stop there. We also seamlessly integrated the ability to compete both in one-on-one mode and in group challenges. And that is not all—we developed and offered our users the opportunity to compete in a comfortable environment alongside their friends.
All of these options are guaranteed to increase a person’s motivation to start their weight-loss journey and to continue it effectively and comfortably for as long as they plan to.
Our application has a clearly structured logical framework. This allows any user to comfortably choose a weight-loss mode that suits them, while we strictly ensure that no harm is done to their health. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend consulting a physician regarding the chosen weight-loss methods.
The first interaction with the app begins with a brief visual overview explaining the principles, distinctions, and effectiveness of our application. This is necessary so that the user immediately understands what they can gain by using our product. Next, we conduct a questionnaire covering key points required to assess the user’s physical condition, weight-loss potential, and habits. This enables us to more accurately define the boundaries within which the weight-loss process will be most comfortable, effective, and safe.
Unfortunately, this approach is suitable for most people, but not everyone. Therefore, we strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional regarding weight-loss plans and methods.
After data collection, the user enters the application itself. We will not focus on the system sections and will instead take a closer look at the competitions section.
Here, the user can choose one or several challenges in which they want to participate. Each type has its own features.
**Against Yourself**
A solo weight-loss challenge. The user chooses how much weight they want to lose, how much money they are willing to bet, and the timeframe in which they want to lose the weight. If the selected parameters are within healthy limits, the bet is accepted. The challenge lasts for the chosen duration.
**One-on-One**
A paired challenge. The user chooses the amount of money they want to bet. The required weight loss is calculated based on their personal parameters. The challenge lasts 2 weeks. We match the user with an opponent with suitable parameters to ensure a fair competition. Winners are determined weekly.
**One-on-One with a Friend**
A paired challenge. The user can create a battle and invite a friend or join an already created battle. When creating a battle, the user chooses the bet amount; when joining an existing battle, this amount is fixed and set by their friend. The required weight loss is calculated based on the user’s parameters. The challenge lasts 2 weeks. Winners are determined weekly.
**Group — Time-Based**
A group challenge. The user chooses the amount they want to bet. The required weight loss is calculated based on their parameters. Opponents are matched according to the selected criteria. The challenge lasts 4 weeks. Winners are determined weekly.
**Group — Weight-Based**
The user chooses the amount of weight they want to lose in 1 week and selects the bet amount. Opponents are matched according to the selected parameters. The challenge lasts 1 week.
**Group with Friends**
A group challenge. The user can create a battle and invite friends or join an already created battle. When creating a battle, the user chooses the bet amount; when joining an existing battle, this amount is fixed and set by a friend. The required weight loss is calculated based on the user’s parameters. The challenge lasts 2 weeks. Winners are determined weekly.
Thus, we offer an optimal set of motivational tools that will be effective for the vast majority of users. We can confidently state that almost anyone will be able to find strong motivation with us to start losing weight and to continue the process effectively.
Let us separately consider the financial model of our application.
A user’s balance consists of three components:
**Personal balance**
**Bonus balance**
**Challenge balance**
The personal balance displays all funds that the user can spend on challenges, in-app purchases, or withdraw to a selected payment system. The personal balance can only be topped up via the chosen payment system.
The bonus balance displays all funds that the user can spend on in-app purchases or exchange for tokens as part of separately planned airdrops. The bonus balance is replenished through the user’s own activity, inviting friends to the app, and the activity of those friends.
The challenge balance shows the portion of the user’s bets that are locked in ongoing challenges.
From the very beginning, we adopted user-friendly pricing principles. Each user independently chooses the size of the bet for any challenge. Everyone decides for themselves what will motivate them without causing discomfort.
This approach allows us to cover any social group and country and helps us adhere to the principles of equality.

**How the User Motivation System Works**
When participating in a challenge, the user chooses the bet amount and transfers it from their personal balance to the challenge balance. This amount is then divided by the number of weeks in the challenge. We also calculate how much weight the user needs to lose each week of the challenge, taking into account the limits based on their personal parameters.
If the user loses weight within the limits set by the challenge, they win and receive the corresponding portion back to their personal balance. If the challenge is not a solo one, the user additionally receives a share of the losses from other participants, thereby increasing their personal balance.
If the user loses, they can choose where a portion of their lost bet will be directed: to various charitable causes, to the development of the project, or to targeted programs, if available. An exception applies to challenges with friends.
Most challenges are available only with a premium subscription, which can be paid for using both the bonus balance and the personal balance.

We would also like to separately address our principles of trust among all participants in the application. From the very beginning, we fully trust our users. Therefore, initial parameters do not require verification. When participating in a challenge, progress is recorded only at the user’s discretion and requires confirmation in the form of a photo of the scale readings. We do not consider additional verification necessary, as any attempt to cheat would ultimately be cheating oneself and nothing more.
Our application is not designed to improve financial well-being; it is designed to improve quality of life. However, in group challenges, honesty becomes more important. Therefore, any group participant may report an opponent. In such cases, moderators may decide to disqualify the participant who attempted to deceive the group for one week or for the entire challenge.
Similarly, any user may report another user for using inappropriate images in their profile, scale photos, or for unacceptable statements in chats or usernames. This is not an exhaustive list. If any prohibited content is discovered, the application team reserves the right to take any reasonable measures, up to and including deleting the user’s account and transferring their data to law enforcement authorities.

**Conclusion**
Slim and Rich is an application designed to increase and sustain motivation during weight loss. We offer users an engaging, game-like experience and an exciting approach to motivation. The relatively short duration of challenges prevents motivation from declining and continuously supports users on their path to an ideal weight.
The absence of entry barriers and complex result verification allows any app user to fully benefit from motivational incentives and successfully complete their weight-loss journey, significantly improving their quality of life. We believe that every kilogram lost with our app represents at least one additional month of a more comfortable and happier life for our users.
Our entire team sincerely aims to give humanity not just years, but thousands of years of life.
